			<p>I'm an undergraduate student currently studying Engineering Science at the University of Toronto, in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Stream. I like getting my hands dirty and working with different types of hardware design. I make circuit boards, software and documentation for the University of Toronto Aerospace Team, Space Systems division, where I serve as Systems Design Lead. Between November 2019 and January 2020 the circuits the team and I built will go up into space on UofT's first undergraduate-built 3U CubeSatellite.</p>
